What's My IP?

This is a tool for determining your dynamic home IP address from a remote location.

I created it because I am spending this spring in Brooklyn but I accidentally left my other laptop at home in Chicago.

To use:
1. Spin up a Firebase (https://www.firebase.com). They're free.
2. Run on the computer to track the IP:
      python server.py <NAME_OF_FIREBASE>
3. Run on a remote computer to check the IP of the server:
      python client.py <NAME_OF_FIREBASE>
